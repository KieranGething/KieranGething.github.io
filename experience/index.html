    <h3>Post-doctoral Research Fellow in River Science</h3>
    <p><strong>Loughborough University</strong> | Loughborough, UK<br>
    <em>Since June 2025</em></p>
    <p>As a Post-doctoral Research Fellow, I contributed to a UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) funded project that advanced understanding of fine sediment impacts on aquatic macroinvertebrate communities.</p>

    <h3>Lecturer in Ecology and Environmental Science</h3>
    <p><strong>Nottingham Trent University</strong> | Nottingham, UK<br>
    <em>Since September 2021</em></p>
    <p>As a Lecturer in Ecology and Environmental Science, I delivered weekly lectures to undergraduate Environmental Biology and Environmental Science students. In this role, I guided students through practical fieldwork, laboratory and data analysis sessions, manage the virtual learning environment, provide feedback and led the Principles of Environmental Science and Freshwater Ecosystems modules. In 2025, my teaching practice was recognised with Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA).</p>

    <h3>Associate Editor</h3>
    <p><strong>African Journal of Aquatic Science</strong> | Remote<br>
    <em>Since October 2025</em></p>
    <p>As an Associate Editor, I supported the editorial process by managing manuscript submissions, coordinating peer reviews, and ensuring the publication of high-quality research. I worked closely with authors, reviewers, and the editorial board to uphold rigorous scientific standards and contribute to advancing knowledge in aquatic ecology and water resource management.</p>

    <h3>Chalk Hydroecology Specialist</h3>
    <p><strong>Environment Agency</strong> | Huntingdon, UK<br>
    <em>September 2024 – April 2025</em></p>
    <p>As a Chalk Hydroecology Specialist, I designed the dry-phase monitoring and data analysis strategy for the Environment Agency’s national temporary chalk stream monitoring programme (NATDEF52). I oversaw the standardisation of flow state records and informed the integration of plant, invertebrate and physicochemical data to proved holistic assessments of ecosystem health in temporary chalk streams. I contributed to the evidence base supporting sampling methods for the DEFRA’s Natural Capital Ecosystem Assessment Small Stream Network (NATDEF38). I fed into guidance on distinguishing rivers and ditches for the purposes of Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG). I led the delivery of the perennial (NATDEF47) and temporary (NATDEF52) chalk stream monitoring programmes for the Anglian region by making regular on-site flow observations, processing invertebrate samples, analysing data and reporting findings to the pan-area chalk team.</p>

    <h3>Post-doctoral Knowledge Exchange Fellow in River Ecology</h3>
    <p><strong>Nottingham Trent University</strong> | Nottingham, UK<br>
    <em>August 2024 – July 2025</em></p>
    <p>As a Knowledge Exchange Fellow, I led an innovative collaboration between Nottingham Trent University and the Environment Agency that informed the development of environmental flow standards for temporary rivers and streams. By integrating existing hydrological and ecological datasets, this project has enhanced the Environment Agency’s capacity to implement sustainable, evidence-based abstraction management practices, has advanced our understanding of human impacts on temporary rivers and streams, and informed future research priorities that may support the health of river ecosystems. I also contributed to the evidence base supporting sampling methods for the DEFRA’s Natural Capital Ecosystem Assessment Small Streams Network.</p>

    <h3>Post-doctoral Research Fellow in River Ecology</h3>
    <p><strong>Nottingham Trent University</strong> | Nottingham, UK<br>
    <em>September 2023 – September 2024</em></p>
    <p>As a Research Fellow in River Ecology, I led a project to identify refuges that allow aquatic invertebrate communities to survive in intermittent streams during dry phases and recolonise after flow resumes. The insights generated by this project are informing adaptation measures that promote the resilience of biodiverse river communities during droughts and climate change. Additionally, this research was directly applied to support the development of the Environment Agency’s national temporary chalk stream monitoring network (NATDEF52). To complete the project, I managed a team of four laboratory assistants by offering training and development opportunities, assigning work and ensuring quality and safety guidelines were adhered to.</p>

    <h3>Demonstrator in Bioscience and Geographic Information Systems</h3>
    <p><strong>Nottingham Trent University</strong> | Nottingham, UK<br>
    <em>October 2020 – September 2023</em></p>
    <p>As a demonstrator, I assisted lecturers in a range of practical sessions and field trips at levels 4–7. My primary duties included supporting undergraduate and postgraduate students learning and applying basic skills (e.g. using microscopes and pipettes, cartography), grading assessments and contributing to the supervision of undergraduate research projects.</p>
