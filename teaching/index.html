    <h3>Lecturing experience</h3>
    <p><strong>Nottingham Trent University</strong> | Nottingham, UK<br>
    <p>As a Lecturer in Ecology and Environmental Science, I primarily teach on the undergraduate Environmental Biology and Environmental Science degree programmes at Nottingham Trent University. In 2025, my teaching practice was recognised with Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA).</p>
    <p><strong>Introduction to Environmental Science (level 4)</strong> - as module leader, I deliver lectures and lead field and laboratory sessions that introduce key concepts and skills to first year undergraduate students. In this module, I attempt to level the playing field by bringing students with a diversity of past experiences up to speed with the requirements of undergraduate study. To achieve this, I design interactive sessions that encourage engagement and provide frequent verbal and written feedback on each student's understanding, field and laboratory technique and written work.</p>
    <p><strong>Freshwater Ecosystems (level 5)</strong> - as module leader, I deliver sessions on macroinvertebrate sampling and identification, data analysis and presentation that mirror the processes used in regulatory biomonitoring. These sessions give students an understanding of how sampling, data analysis and write-up all fit into real-world practice, improving engagement and employability.</p>
    <p><strong>Geographic Information Systems (level 7)</strong> - as a demonstrator, I provide technical support to masters students using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In this role, I provide in-depth tutorial materials, guide students through complex processes and provide real-time support for the varying levels of experience and confidence that are common in GIS classrooms.</p>
    <p><strong>Research supervision (levels 6, 7 and 8)</strong> - as a research supervisor, I guide students at levels 6–8 through every element of independent study, from design to write-up. At level 8, I support PhD researcher <strong>Robert Collier</strong> in his work assessing the effectiveness of restoration activities on temporary chalk stream physical habitat conditions and invertebrate communities.</p>

    <h3>Professional training</h3>
    <p><strong>Environment Agency</strong> | Various locations, UK<br>
    <p><strong>Field methods</strong> - as a chalk hydroecology specialist, I designed and delivered bespoke aquatic and terrestrial invertebrate sampling training for members of the Environment Agency's national pan-area chalk ecology team. I also provided tailored sessions on the Modular River Physical Habitat Survey (MoRPh) and led comparisons with the widely used River Habitat Survey (RHS).</p>
    <p><strong>Environmental flow design</strong> - as a Post-doctoral Knowledge Exchange Fellow, I designed and delivered a collaborative workshop with attendees from academia and the Environment Agency. The workshop opened with presentations on the current state of knowledge, before breaking out into specialist working groups that designed environmental flow standards for human-influenced temporary flow regiemes.</p>
